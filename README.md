*Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code or BASIC for Short*

The Official Rosewell BASIC Operating System Available on Github.

This is a Rosewell Software Project called Rosewell BASIC.

A recreation of an old Operation System called BASIC.
BASIC was originally From the 80's.
This version currently uses Python Syntax but in some ways can be superior

Rosewell BASIC TEST Files.zip are some Example PROGRAMS for Rosewell BASIC, NOTE; Some PROGRAMS Require the clrprint module to work.

The Instruction Video can be downloaded from the Releases Tab or from this Youtube Link:

Check out my first project Rosewell OS Here:

NOTE; There is a input bug that will be fixed in a later version, the new GUI's can't assign the input to a variable as there is no console, so I will come up with a solution for the next release

V2.0 of the Rosewell Software Official Seal of Quality will come with all new releases

There is a bundled zip file that contains a folder for the APP versions!
