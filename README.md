*Beginner's All-Purpose Symbolic Instruction Code or BASIC for Short*

The Official Rosewell BASIC Operating System Available on Github.

This is a new Rosewell Software Project called Rosewell BASIC.

A recreation of an old Operation System called BASIC.
BASIC was originally From the 80's.
This version currently uses Python Syntax but in some ways can be superior

Rosewell BASIC TEST Files.zip are some Example PROGRAMS for Rosewell BASIC, NOTE; Some PROGRAMS Require the clrprint module to work.

The Rosewell BASIC GUI is here!!!!

The Instruction Video can be downloaded from the Releases Tab or from this Youtube Link:

Check out my first project Rosewell OS Here:

NOTE; There is a input bug that will be fixed in a later version, the new GUI's can't assign the input to a variable as there is no console, so I will come up with a solution for the next release


There is a bundled zip file that contains a folder for the new GUI and APP versions!
